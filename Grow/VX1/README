 implemented

 -Switching from time scrubbing state to real time 
    -In scrub time the player is able to move backward and forward (up to the present)
    -Time will tick forward when the player stops scrubbing in order to have a sense of activity
-Creating a log file which stores the real time elapsed and automatically reloads when the player begins a new session





 To Implement 
 -loggin the time since the save slot was created
 -instatiating and de-instatiating entities as a function of time. 



PSEUDO CODE / THINKING
 -> all entities will contain an implict growth function which ultimately dictates their time of death 
    -> although the birth time is stochastic their death is pre-determined by time. 
        -> modifications to that growth function can be made in -game which alters the time of death 
 -> a for loop can check if the current scrub time is equal to any of the instantiation times and spawn plants if so
