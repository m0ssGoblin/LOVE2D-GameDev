# LOVE2D-GameDev
LOVE2d Game experiments using Lua

This is a Repo for experiments with LOVE 2D. 
Love 2D is a lightweight game framework using the Lua programming language. 
Lua is one of the languages slotted for use for the playdate handheld game console to be released in 2021. 

An SDK for the playdate will likley be released sometime after july 2021. 
In th emeantime, many of the lessons learned with LOVE2D are liekly to translate to the playdate.



|---------   GROW   ------------|

Much of this Repo is tutorials or source code but the *Grow* project is an original creation. 
Grow is more simulation than game and has the player take more of an observational role as a small plot of land becomes inhabitted by organisms. 

The core feature of the game makes use of the playdate's unique crank to advance time to the present. 
This allows the user to quickly scrub through the time that they were away i.e. since they last boote dup the game. 
Unlikle real-life this will give the user a chance to watch their plants grow and see what other events occurred or critters came to visit.
Also unlike real-life players will have limitted control of the plot. Seeds will "blow-in" to the players inventory and they may chose to plant them or not.
